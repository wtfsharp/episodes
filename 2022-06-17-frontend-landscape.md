# WTF# is the F# Front-End Landscape?

Episode Hosts: Angel, Matt, and Stachu

Recording 2022, June 17, 10am EST

We'll stream it somewhere - apparently twitch.tv/wtfsharp is taken! So figuring out alternative. :)

## Things to cover:
- [F# Weekly 2022.24](https://sergeytihon.com/2022/06/11/f-weekly-24-2022-fable-4-snake-island-dark-in-f-net-7-preview-4)
- Angel's [Exploring the F# Frontend Landscape](https://dev.to/tunaxor/exploring-the-f-frontend-landscape-13aa)

## TODOs:
- review the F# weekly; extract some notes
- re-read Angel's post; prepare some questions
- plan some notes around Dark (mentioned in F# weekly)
