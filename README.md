# WTF# Episodes

This repository is meant to be a place of organizing the planning, scheduling, recording, editing, and publication of (audio) WTF# episodes.
As such, I don't imagine this repo consisting of many files besides this readme (and maybe a license, if I think that through). Rather, this is just a shell to host GitHub issues in.

Issues in this repository should be:
- episodes that I plan on recording
- episodes recommendations made by YOU! (willing to be recorded? Or have a request for me covering some F#-related topic)?
- I guess some other things would be ok too

## What should guests expect?

A ~3-4 hour total commitment on your end.

For each episode with a guest, the rough structure is the following:
- [you, 15mins] 15-min skype / zoom / hangouts call between myself and you to discuss at a high level what we can cover in an episode of 30-60mins
- Stachu creates rough episode outline and links you to it
- [you, 30-60mins] You make any relevant updates to that structure
- [us, 90mins] We have a ~90min recording call together
- I update the outline with show notes that I'll later use
- [you, 30mins] Alter these show notes as you wish
- I re-record the intro, for my own sake
- I sent the audio to @fergusmeiklejohn and he gets it back to me
- I upload the audio to my podcast host thing (fireside), adding show notes, and publishing

A bit of planning in the beginning is little stress, and makes for a much better end product!
