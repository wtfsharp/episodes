# WTF# Episodes

This repository is meant to be a place of organizing the planning, scheduling, recording, editing, and publication of (audio) WTF# episodes.
As such, I don't imagine this repo consisting of many files besides this readme (and maybe a license, if I think that through). Rather, this is just a shell to host GitHub issues in.

Issues in this repository should be:
- episodes that I plan on recording
- episodes recommendations made by YOU! (willing to be recorded? Or have a request for me covering some F#-related topic)?
- I guess some other things would be ok too
